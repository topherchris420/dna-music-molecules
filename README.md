# DNA is F♯ | The Molecular Music Synthesizer

> *from molecule to melody, from genome to symphony — life composes itself.*

An immersive web synthesizer that transforms DNA sequences into sound by mapping the infrared vibrational frequencies of nucleotide bases (Adenine, Thymine, Cytosine, Guanine) to musical pitches in the F♯ scale.

## 🧬 About

This project brings molecular biology to life through sound, based on groundbreaking research by composer **Susan Alexjander** and biologist **David Deamer**. Using infrared spectroscopy data, each DNA base vibrates at a specific frequency that, when scaled to the audible range, creates a harmonic musical scale centered around F♯.

**DNA Base Frequencies:**
- **Adenine (A)**: 545.6 Hz → C#
- **Thymine (T)**: 543.4 Hz → C#
- **Cytosine (C)**: 537.8 Hz → C
- **Guanine (G)**: 550.0 Hz → C#

## 🔬 Scientific Background

This project is inspired by the pioneering work of:

- **Susan Alexjander** - Composer who mapped DNA frequencies to musical scales
- **David Deamer** - Biologist who measured DNA infrared absorption spectra

Their research revealed that DNA bases vibrate at frequencies that, when transposed down ~30 octaves, fall into a coherent musical scale. This suggests a fundamental relationship between molecular structure and harmonic principles.

## 📱 Mobile Experience

The app is fully optimized for mobile devices with:
- Touch-friendly UI with 44px+ touch targets
- Swipeable organism carousel
- Bottom sheet controls for easy access
- Collapsible sections to maximize screen space
- Responsive typography and spacing
